Implementation of models and algorithms for the assortment planning problem (AP)

For the project, the code and the report are combined in the `notebook.ipynb` file. You can run all the notebook without problem since it will load the results we saved. If you want to run a particular model/algorithm, you can just uncomment the line in the specific cell. The data we used are in the `data` folder and the results that we show in the notebook are in the `results` folder.
