    "In this project, we focus on the Assortment Planning Problem (AP), where a retailer wants to determine which products it has to propose to its customers in order to maximize its expected revenue. More precisely, consider a set of products $\\mathcal{I}=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ that the retailer can propose to its customers, and selling product $i$ generates a net revenue of $r_{i}>0$ for him. We assume that the products are sorted in decreasing order of revenue, i.e. $r_{1}>r_{2}>\\cdots>r_{n}>0$, and that each product $i$ will be purchased according to a particular probability that depends on:\n",
